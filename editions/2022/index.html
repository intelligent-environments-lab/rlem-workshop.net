<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h2>

<p>Buildings account for 40% of the global energy consumption and 30% of the associated greenhouse gas emissions, while also offering a 50–90% CO2 mitigation potential. The transportation sector is responsible for an additional 30%. Optimal decarbonization requires electrification of end-uses and concomitant decarbonization of electricity supply, efficient use of electricity for lighting, space heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC), and domestic hot water generation, and upgrade of the thermal properties of buildings. A major driver for decarbonization are integration of renewable energy systems (RES) into the grid, and photovoltaics (PV) and solar-thermal collectors as well as thermal and electric storage into residential and commercial buildings. Electric vehicles (EVs), with their storage capacity and inherent connectivity, hold a great potential for integration with buildings.</p>

<p>The integration of these technologies must be done carefully to unlock their full potential. Artificial intelligence is regarded as a possible pathway to orchestrate these complexities of Smart Cities. In particular, (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms have seen an increased interest and have demonstrated human expert level performance in other domains, e.g., computer games. Research in the building and cities domain has been fragmented and with focus on different problems and using a variety of frameworks. The purpose of this Workshop is to build a growing community around this exciting topic, provide a platform for discussion for future research direction, and share common frameworks.</p>

    <td class="tg-0pky">In this work, we discuss a method to incorporate domain knowledge into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment through the process of behavioral cloning, in the context of a district energy management system. Prior knowledge, encoded into heuristic rule-based programs, is used to initialize a policy network for an RL agent, after which an RL algorithm is used to improve on this by optimizing against a reward function. The key ideas are implemented in the CityLearn framework, where the resulting controller is used to manage the electrical energy storage for 5 buildings in a district. We demonstrate that the resulting agents offer measurable performance gains compared to existing baselines, offering a 3.8% improvement over the underlying rule-based controller, and a 20% improvement over a pure RL based controller. We also illustrate the possibility of using imitation learning to develop agents with desirable characteristics without explicit reward shaping.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">In smart energy systems, batteries, which assume an important role in filling the temporal gap between generation and consumption, are expected to be a potential distributed energy resource (DER). A resource aggregator (RA) has emerged to collect various DERs to extract demand-side flexibility, and various methods have been proposed based on reinforcement learning. Since battery degradation is unavoidable during utilization, battery management is required to minimize it. This paper proposes state-of-health (SOH)-aware battery management based on deep reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate an average battery lifetime improvement of 11.2%.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has started showing success in real-world applications such as building energy optimization. Much of the research in this space utilized simulated environments to train RL-agent in an offline mode. Very few research have used DRL-based control in real-world systems due to two main reasons: 1) sample efficiency challenge---DRL approaches need to perform a lot of interactions with the environment to collect sufficient experiences to learn from, which is difficult in real systems, and 2) comfort or safety related constraints---user's comfort must never or at least rarely be violated. In this work, we propose a novel deep Reinforcement Learning framework with online Data Augmentation (RLDA) to address the sample efficiency challenge of real-world RL. We used a time series Generative Adversarial Network (TimeGAN) architecture as a data generator. We further evaluated the proposed RLDA framework using a case study of an intelligent HVAC control. With a ≈28% improvement in the sample efficiency, RLDA framework lays the way towards increased adoption of DRL-based intelligent control in real-world building energy management systems.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">Batch reinforcement learning (BRL) is an emerging research area in the RL community. It learns exclusively from static datasets (i.e. replay buffers) without interaction with the environment. In the offline settings, existing replay experiences are used as prior knowledge for BRL models to find the optimal policy. Thus, generating replay buffers is crucial for BRL model benchmark. In our B2RL (Building Batch RL) dataset, we collected real-world data from our building management systems, as well as buffers generated by several behavioral policies in simulation environments. We believe it could help building experts on BRL research. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to open-source building datasets for the purpose of BRL learning.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">The intersection of buildings control and thermal comfort modeling may seem obvious, but there are still prevalent challenges in combining them. "Occupant centric" control strategies are mainly trained using building data but rarely leverage occupants' feedback. While thermal comfort models are developed using occupants' data but are seldom integrated into building controls. To bridge this gap, we developed an open-source simulation tool named ComfortLearn. ComfortLearn is an OpenAI Gym-based environment that leverages historical building management system data from real buildings and existing longitudinal thermal comfort datasets for occupant-centric control strategies and benchmarking. We used an evaluation metric named 'exceedance' to evaluate occupants' thermal comfort and provide a more realistic picture than traditional evaluations like comfort bands. This setup allows the analysis of different building control strategies and their effect on real occupants, based on empirical data, without the need for computationally expensive co-simulations. A theoretical case study implementation shows that an as-is schedule-based controller complies with its comfort band more than 93% of the time, but the simulated occupants are comfortable for only 25% of the occupied time.</td>
