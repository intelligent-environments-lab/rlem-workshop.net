<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h2>
<p>Buildings account for 40% of the global energy consumption and 30% of the associated greenhouse gas emissions, while also offering a 50–90% CO2 mitigation potential. The transportation sector is responsible for an additional 30%. Optimal decarbonization requires electrification of end-uses and concomitant decarbonization of electricity supply, efficient use of electricity for lighting, space heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC), and domestic hot water generation, and upgrade of the thermal properties of buildings. A major driver for decarbonization are integration of renewable energy systems (RES) into the grid, and photovoltaics (PV) and solar-thermal collectors as well as thermal and electric storage into residential and commercial buildings. Electric vehicles (EVs), with their storage capacity and inherent connectivity, hold a great potential for integration with buildings.</p>

<p>The integration of these technologies must be done carefully to unlock their full potential. Artificial intelligence is regarded as a possible pathway to orchestrate these complexities of Smart Cities. In particular, (deep) reinforcement learning algorithms have seen an increased interest and have demonstrated human expert level performance in other domains, e.g., computer games. Research in the building and cities domain has been fragmented and with focus on different problems and using a variety of frameworks. The purpose of this Workshop is to build a growing community around this exciting topic, provide a platform for discussion for future research direction, and share common frameworks.</p>

    <td class="tg-0pky"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none">Internet of things has revolutionized the interaction between devices, actuators, sensors, and individuals in a building. Effective integration of these assets in buildings has critical role in providing load flexibility to support grid resiliency. In addition to a frequently changing load shape due to new demand patterns, the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources adds variability to power generation. The grid needs a reliable control system to coordinate the effects of these changes in real time to ensure safe and reliable operation. To address this, many optimization methods have been developed and researched. However, many of the existing approaches cannot adapt to the changes in the environment. Model-free reinforcement learning has gained a lot of attention in recent years for creating the optimal load schedule in buildings to provide benefits for building and utility stakeholders. In this talk, we will discuss a scalable software framework and various deep model-free RL algorithms that we have developed, and field tested over the past few years for optimal operation of the buildings.</span></td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">This paper discusses an approach to optimizing the performance of an end-to-end data-driven control approach for building energy management. The proposed approach, designed for systems that exhibit non-stationary behavior, involves two primary components: (1) performance degradation detection, followed by (2) relearning a set of data-driven models of the system to update the controller policy using a reinforcement learning approach. The overall control framework involves a large hyperparameter space that has to be tuned for "optimal" performance. In this paper, we analyze the sensitivity and robustness to a small set of relevant hyperparameters that have a significant impact on the overall performance. We study the performance in terms of the accuracy of the derived data-driven models that support relearning and the speed of convergence of the reinforcement learning controller.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">Automatic control of energy systems is affected by the uncertainties of multiple factors, including weather, prices and human activities. The literature relies on Markov-based control, taking only into account the current state. This impacts control performance, as previous states give additional context for decision making. We present two ways to learn non-Markovian policies, based on recurrent neural networks and variational inference. We evaluate the methods on a simulated data centre HVAC control task. The results show that the off-policy stochastic latent actor-critic algorithm can maintain the temperature in the predefined range within three months of training without prior knowledge while reducing energy consumption compared to Markovian policies by more than 5%.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume nearly 40% of the total energy consumption in developed countries. Traditional techniques such as rule based control (RBC) fail to control these systems in an optimal way. Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely explored in literature as well but it doesn't represent a practical solution due to the complexity of buildings' dynamics that it relies on. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great success in the domain of optimal control such as robotics and gaming. In this paper, we develop two model-free DRL approaches to optimize the energy consumption of an office while maintaining thermal comfort and good indoor air quality through controlling the radiator and the opening/closing of a window and a door existing in the office. The two DRL approaches belong to deep-Q network (DQN): the first approach represents a DQN agent with no knowledge of the environment and the second approach represents a DQN agent with initial knowledge of the environment: A hybrid approach DQN+RBC. The goal of having external knowledge in DQN agent is to boost convergence by exploiting the RBC rules. We evaluate the performance of these two approaches against an RBC approach through simulations using a physical model of the office's dynamics. Experiments show that the two DRL approaches succeeded to maintain better thermal comfort and better indoor air quality compared with RBC approach while consuming nearly the same energy. In addition, experiments demonstrate that the DQN with knowledge outperforms the DQN with no knowledge in the beginning and converges faster to the optimal value.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">Optimal control of complex engineering systems is an extremely hard task. The classical approach, based on optimal control concepts (such as model-predictive control), is infeasible for large-scale systems where the accurate model is unavailable or is expensive to develop. Thus, machine learning (ML) approaches are becoming a popular alternative. In this talk, we will overview two most popular ML-based approaches, one based on reinforcement learning and another based on data-driven predictive control, their variants, and their application to optimal control of grid-interactive buildings.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) approaches for intelligent control of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). Deep-Q-network (DQN) is used as a candidate for model-free RL algorithm. The two control strategies were developed for residential demand-response (DR) HVAC system. We considered MPC as our golden standard to compare DQN's performance. The question we tried to answer through this work was, What % of MPC's performance can be achieved by model-free RL approach for intelligent HVAC control?. Based on our test result, RL achieved an average of ≈ 62% daily cost saving of MPC. Considering the pure optimization and model-based nature of MPC methods, the RL showed very promising performance. We believe that the interpretations derived from this comparative analysis provide useful insights to choose from various DR approaches and further enhance the performance of the RL-based methods for building energy managements.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">The ongoing industrialization and rising technology adoption around the world are leading to ever higher energy consumption. The benefits of electrification are enormous, but the growing demand also comes with challenges with respect to associated greenhouse gas emissions. Although continuing progress in energy research has brought up new technologies in energy generation, storage, and distribution, most of those technologies focus on increasing efficiency of individual components. Work on integration and coordination abilities between individual components in micro-grids will lead to further improvements and gains in efficiency that are necessary to reduce carbon footprints and slow down climate change. To this end, the CityLearn environment provides a simulation framework that allows the control of energy components in buildings that are organized in districts. In this paper, we propose an energy management system based on the decentralized actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm MARLISA but integrate a centralized critic and call it MARLISA<sub>DSCC</sub>. In this way, we are training a model to autonomously control the energy storage of individual buildings in a CityLearn district to improve demand response guided by a better informed training signal. We show performance increases over baseline control techniques for a district but also discuss the resulting action selection for individual buildings.</td>
