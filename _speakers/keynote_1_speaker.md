    <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharathanbalaji/" target="_blank">Bharathan Balaji</a> is an applied scientist in Amazon working on sustainability. He is interested in developing methods and systems that help make the world a better place: by reducing waste, through education, and with automation. He has worked on reinforcement learning, smart buildings and internet of things technologies. He has published 62 articles and has >3000 citations.</p>

    <p>Since joining Amazon in 2018, he has contributed to the launch of SageMaker RL, a platform for RL workloads in AWS, and to the launch of AWS DeepRacer, a 1/18th scale car that drives autonomously using RL. He has helped 10+ AWS customers in supply chain, computing, industrial control, and many others. He collaborates with academic researchers in UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego.</p>

    <p>He was a Postdoc in UCLA for 2 years, where he worked on the intersection of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning. He developed technology to personalize notifications, monitor aquatic animals, and energy harvesting indoor sensors. He mentored 10+ graduate students during this time. He published 11 papers in venues such as BuildSys, Applied Energy, Transactions on CPS, and started a workshop on Safe IoT, now part of IEEE S&P.</p>

    <p>He did his PhD in UC San Diego in smart buildings, where he developed a software stack for buildings for automation, convenience, and saving energy. He created wireless sensors that detect occupancy, measure plug load energy. He designed an occupancy inference method with WiFi signals. He developed a software thermostat that improved comfort and identified faults, it was deployed in the CSE building for 5+ years. In collaboration with 7 institutions, I made a knowledge graph for buildings that is now adopted in industry, and in discussions to become part of a standard in ASHRAE.</p>
